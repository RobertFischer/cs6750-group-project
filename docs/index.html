		<h1>Podcast Head-to-Head Discovery Prototype</h1>
		<p class="lead">March Madness style podcast discovery!</p>

		<h2>Caveats</h2>
		<p class="lead">This is a <em>medium fidelity prototype</em> and therefore is prototyping with the intent of answering specific questions.  It is not a fully functional final product and therefore has many known limitations. You need to overlook these limitations in order to focus on the questions being asked by this prototype.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>This prototype is testing the idea of using a head-to-head competition style. <strong>There is currently no smarts built into this 
					system</strong>, but a final product would pick competitors based on previous responses from the users. Please do not consider the quality of the match-ups when evaluating the prototype, but instead the idea of having head-to-head matchups.</li>
			<li>This prototype is giving a sense of the kinds of information that would be provided for your consideration. <strong>The actual layout and presentation of the information is very quick-and-dirty</strong>, but a final product would present that information in a more refined way.  Please do not consider the presentation of the information, but instead the kinds of information being presented.</li>
			<li>This prototype is demonstrating the interface, not actually providing a means for you to discover podcasts. <strong>The number of competitors is very small in this system</strong>, but a final product would be drawing from a variety of sources for podcast discovery.  Please do not consider the particular podcasts, but instead the idea of a variety of podcasts eligible for competition.</li>
